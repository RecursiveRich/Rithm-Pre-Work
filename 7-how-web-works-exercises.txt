1. Http is the protocol governing how computers communicate over the internet (vs ftp or email)
2. Uniform resource locator: human readable web address
3. TCP is the protocol for making sure all packets sent have arrived (like signing for a Fedex shipment)
4. Internet Protocol
5. Domain name system: Looks up ip address corresponding to URL
6. Idempotent: a request that makes no change to the server 
7. Query string is the part of the URL beginning with ? that contains key-value parameters
8. The specific file on the server being requested
9. Get - just requesting data, like a home page.  
Post - changing server eg logging in with a password or creating an account 
Head - just requesting header eg to make sure url still active 
Delete - delete data from server
1. client is the requesting computer
2. server is the responding computer
3. Http request is the request sent by the client per http protocol
4. Http response is sent by the server
5. Http header is part of an http response or request that gives basic information, separate from the body:
e.g. ip address for the client, http verb for the reqeust
        e.g. status code, date, content type (e.g. text/html)
1. REST is a stateless, scalable architecture for building applications that communicate with other applications
2. JSON is javascript object notation: key-value pairs of strings
3. an http request is sent to the service provider
        DNS determines the IP address
        the request is routed through a number of routers until it reaches the server
        the server formulates a response and sends it back to the client
        the client's browser renders the html into a DOM and sends additional requests for img 
files, script files, etc. 
1. Stateless means that the server does not need to retain data about a previous request.
2. cURL is an application to send http requests from the command line
3. curl http://omdapi.com?t=titanic
